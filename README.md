# WorldWalker

This is the front end repository for WorldWalker.

**WorldWalker** is a full-stack vacation planning web application that I developed independently to strengthen my skills in **web development**, **backend architecture**, and **cloud deployment**. It is a personal project, and every aspect of the project—from planning to coding to deployment—was completed by me.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Frontend Server**: Node.js
- **Backend**: Spring Boot + Spring Security  
- **Database**: MySQL
