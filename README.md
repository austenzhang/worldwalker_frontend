# WorldWalker

This is the front end repository for WorldWalker.

**WorldWalker** is a full-stack vacation planning web application that I developed independently to strengthen my skills in **web development**, **backend architecture**, and **cloud deployment**. It is a personal project, and every aspect of the projectâ€”from planning to coding to deploymentâ€”was completed by me.
